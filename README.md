This plasmoid is inspired by applications like Caffeine that allow
an icon on the taskbar to be clicked and toggle screen lock inhibition.

## Installation

Install this plasmoid using `plasmapkg2 --install .` in the plasmoid directory.

## Configuration

Both the on and off state icons can be configured to any arbitrary icon.
